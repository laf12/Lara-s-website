The Build It Weekend is a national university-level hardware hackathon, the goal is to design, build and program a working prototype of a project that is both innovative and useful.

My team and I decided to help dyslexic people learn to play the piano. Our prototype helps the user by replacing written piano notes with flashing LED mounted piano keys to designate the appropriate key to press in order to complete the musical. The piano also features a game mode most relevant in tutoring cases, where the instructor can play a specific song on the piano which will then teach it to the student by segmentation of the keynotes.
