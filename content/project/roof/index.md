For our Mechanics of Machines project, we are required to design and construct a retractable roof. Our goal is to design a roof that:
1) Uses Shape Memory Alloys
2) Takes 5 seconds to open then 5 seconds to close
3) Is as lightest as possible
4) Can be constructed at the least possible cost
5) Has a large extended area compared to the retracted area

However, there are some constraints on the design which include:
1) It must have 20 cm elevation
2) It canâ€™t be supported from the middle
3) The size of the roof should be 625 cm2; however, the overall size of the design (including the support) should not exceed 1600 cm2 when expanded.

Our design consists of 6 triangular panels, each connected to a base panel using a hinge represented by a pin in a slot on our Solid Works model. Each of these base panels are attached to the ground using pins, around which they oscillate. Every two triangles are connected together from the top using three dimensional hinges; giving us a total of three door system working simultaneously. Upon activation using a shape memory alloy, the expansion starts from the middle of the roof where the panels oscillate until the roof is opened. This is clearly visualized in the SolidWorks model attached in the report. For the material of the roof, we will be using Plexiglas because it is a strong, tough, and lightweight material; moreover, it has a low cost.
