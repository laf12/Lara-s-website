Helicopters are of significant importance due to their extensive usage in military and civilian applications. Helicopters are differentiated by their ability for vertical landing and take-off; however, they often involve complex nonlinear dynamics and unstable systems. We present several control schemes for the single input single output (SISO) system and we analyze the performance of the model reference adaptive control on the coupled multiple input multiple output system (MIMO). Moreover, other controllers such as an LQR, LQE and LQG were designed and used.
