I am currently pursuing a MSc in Robotics at the University of Michigan. I have also joined the CURLY Lab as a graduate student research assistant under the guidance of Prof. Maani Ghaffari.
Throughout my undergraduate career at the American University of Beirut, I developed a deep and passionate interest in the field of Robotics and Control Systems. My knowledge in this field is always expanding, whether by working on several projects or by working on my research topics. I am always looking for ways to increase my knowledge in Robotics and hopefully implement it for good use in this world.
