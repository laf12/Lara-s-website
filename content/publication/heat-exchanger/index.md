abstract: "Heat Exchangers are widely used in the industrial space in order to deliver adequate desired temperatures for different usage. Applications of Heat Exchangers range from household temperature maintenance to industrial machinery operations. The fundamental basis of the Heat Exchanger is the heat transfer law between two or more fluids for cooling and heating purposes. The importance of a Heat Exchanger thus lies in the control of the temperature of the outlet fluid that needs to reach a specific temperature in order not to damage the process it is fed to. "
