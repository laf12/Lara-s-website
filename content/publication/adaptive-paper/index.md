abstract: "This paper examines the performance of different control schemes on the 2-DOF Quanser AERO helicopter. We present several control schemes for the single input single output (SISO) system and we analyze the performance of the model reference adaptive control on the coupled multiple input multiple output system (MIMO). We show that for the SISO system, the indirect self-tuning regulator (ISTR) and the MRAC output feedback show a very good performance. Addtionally, the MIMO MRAC controller presents very good model following and good disturbance rejection."
